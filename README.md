# love2d-bootstrap

This is a skeleton project you can use to start your next LÖVE 2D project.

To run this project, install [Lua](http://www.lua.org/download.html) and [LÖVE 2D](https://www.love2d.org/) framework.

Open a command prompt and execute `love <project_path>` where `project_path` is the path where you downloaded this project.

Alternatively you can compress the example folder into a ZIP file and change the file extension from `.zip` into `.love`, then you just double-click the file to open the example. The ZIP file should contain only the contents of the folder and not the folder itself.
